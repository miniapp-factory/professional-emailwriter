#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### drafts business, marketing, or support emails.  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files that are not currently in the chat:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create or modify this file to describe the logo image you want to generate.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
